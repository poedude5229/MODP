# MODP
- MODP is a modular React component in its early stages of design. This project is open source and will be a browser based, RSS compatible audio player.

## Project Goals
- Users will be able to upload audio tracks to hosting sites, and will be able to play these tracks back using MODP's UI. This will replace default browser audio players in my projects and yours.
- Release date anticipated mid 2025. MVP before GTA6.

### Inspiration
- The name and some technology draw inspiration from my experience using Music On Console and MDP Debian/Ubuntu packages on embedded systems.
